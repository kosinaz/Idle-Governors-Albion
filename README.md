# Idle Governors: Albion
Idle Governors: Albion is an incremental (idle/clicker) game in which your goal is to become the greatest governor of Albion by constantly expanding your settlement with bigger and better buildings that allow you to gather and sell more and more resources.

## Trade routes
The main progress bar of the game is the length of your trade routes that connect your settlement with settlements of other players or the computer. Every other settlement serves as a new milestone. For a certain amount and type of resources, they automatically offer you a trade agreement, that unlocks useful upgrades for your buildings. The further you reach the slower your traders will build the route so you have to constantly upgrade their equipment to progress.

## Coin
The main currency of the game is the coin. You can sell your resources and buy upgrades for coins.

## Resources
The resources of the game are food, lumber, clay, stone, coal, bronze, iron, silver, gold and diamond. Food is the least valuable resource and diamond is the most valuable. Resources are needed to buy new buildings and for trade agreements

## Castle
The main limitation of the game is the size of your castle. The bigger your castle is the more resource you can have. To upgrade the size of your castle you have to sell your resources for coins and buy upgrades. Clicking on the castle produces a certain amount and type of resources based on your upgrades.

## Buildings
You can have buildings to produce each type of the resource. They are producing resources over a certain amount of time-based on your upgrades. Buildings that produce more valuable resources are made of less valuable resources. 

## Upgrades
You can upgrade the equipment of your traders to help them establish the trade routes faster, the tools of the castle to produce more and better resources when you click on the castle, the size of the castle to hold more resources, and the technology of your buildings to help them produce the resources faster.
